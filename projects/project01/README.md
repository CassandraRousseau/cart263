# Project 01: A Night at the Movies

##Find your Spark!-Cassandra Rousseau

This project is based on Disney's animated movie _Soul_. The sequence I focused on in this simulation is where and how the baby souls in the _Great Before_ find their reason to live, which is also called 'finding your spark'. To realize this sequence, I choose to create a simulation of 'finding your spark'.
The user could explore a recreated WEBGL environment of the _Great Before_ places found in the movie,where they could follow the same process to fing their passion as the souls.

To create interactivity in the simulation, I decided to make the user control simulation's camera with their index through the use of ml5.js' Handpose. The user could explore the places and choose their career by using vocal commands through annyang! Furthermore, the user could also call a manual to see which place they could go and which career they could do.

To create an aesthetically pleasing WEBGL environment, I used multiple OBJ files and multiple images to create textures on the objects. To reduce the number of files in this heavy program, I used JSON files to group multiple variables of repeated objects.

My goal was to create an immersive world where users could play the role of baby soul like those shown in the movie; where they could follow the same process as them to find what they attire them.
