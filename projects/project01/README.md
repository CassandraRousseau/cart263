# Project 01: A Night at the Movies

**Find your Spark!-Cassandra Rousseau**

This project is based on Disney’s animated movie _Soul_. The sequence I focused on in this simulation is where and how the baby souls in the _Great Before_ find their reason to live, which is also called “finding your spark.” To realize this sequence, I choose to create a simulation of “finding your spark”. The users explore a recreated WEBGL environment of the _Great Before_ and its places. They follow the same process as the souls to find their passion before becoming human. To make some links between my simulation and the movie itself, I added a video of a sequence of the movie at the beginning of the simulation to introduce the users to the universe and used the movie soundtrack made for the _Hall of Everything_ during the simulation.

To create interactivity in the simulation, I decided to make the users control simulation’s camera with their index through the use of ml5.js’ Handpose. The users could explore the places and choose their career by using vocal commands through annyang! Furthermore, the users could also call a manual to see which place they could go and which career they could do.

To create an aesthetically pleasing WEBGL environment, I used multiple OBJ files and multiple images to create textures on the objects. To reduce the number of files in this heavy program, I used JSON files to group multiple variables of repeated objects.
I decided to make my project in WEBGL to being closer to the original version and also to personally discover the world of WEBGL.

My goal was to create an immersive world where users could play the role of a baby soul like those shown in the movie; where they could follow the same process as them to find what is appealing to them. By using the _Great Before_ soundtrack, I wanted the users to live a soothing yet pleasant experience during the simulation.
