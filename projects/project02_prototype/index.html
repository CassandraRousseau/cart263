        Hello human!
      </p>
      <p>Welcome to the U&I experience!</p>
      <p>My name is I and I’ll be your host during this journey.</p>
      <p>
        Before starting, my creators and myself want to thank you for your
        3-days trial subscription to this program.
      </p>
      <p>So are you ready?</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>Oh yeah right! I forgot to mention. Hahaha silly me.</p>
      <p>
        U&I experience is a program in which my creators want to study if there
        is a possibility that humans could create a more intimate relationship
        with machines, especially AI, which is what I am!
      </p>
      <p>
        They needed some lab rats to make this experiment, just like you!
      </p>
      <p>But hey, it is not scary! They just want us to be friends! *smile*</p>
      <p>On this note, do you want to be my friend?</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>So let’s begin our beautiful and wonderful friendshippppp!</p>
      <p>
        This first module of this experience is intimacy; my creators have to
        analyze the possibility of a developing intimacy between humans and
        machines.
      </p>
      <p>So, I had super duper good idea to get to know each other!</p>
      <p>Well, my creators had this idea but that is just a detail.</p>
      <p>Let’s play a mix of this or that and twenty questions game!</p>
      <p>
        I know, I know, I know, humans especially use these games these days to
        spicing up their dating life.
      </p>
      <p>
        But hey, what is better than an useless relationship that will end
        badly?
      </p>
      <p>Our friendship!</p>
      <p>So let’s use this game to develop our…</p>
      <p>Friendshipppppppppp!</p>
