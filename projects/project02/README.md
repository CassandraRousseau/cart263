_Flufluf_-Cassandra Rousseau

_Flufluf_ is a platform game made with Phaser 3. The storyline is about Flufluf, the player's avatar, who saves the baby clouds kidnapped by an evil squad of clouds. The main character, Flufluf, will rescue the baby clouds from the enemies by collecting them through each level. The player has to get through each level and fight the enemies to complete the game.

I wanted players to relive their childhood memories about _Super Mario Bros._, _Kirby_ or _Sonic the Hedghehog_ through this gameplay. To give tribute to these games, level layouts look similar to the first platformers: simple blocks piled up in an environment. The art style given to the levels is pixel art. This type of art gives a retro visual aspect that reminds the simple visual quality of older games. I added a bitmap font within levels to keep the pixelized characteristic. The controls are as simple as those used for this type of game. The storyline also has a retro characteristic by giving a very vagueness context of the game's universe.

_Phaser 3_, _Tiled_, _Piskel_ and _Adobe Photoshop_ are the software and engines that corresponded the most with the artistic vision of this project. _Piskel_ to create pixelized animations of characters._Adobe Photoshop_ helped to create the illustrations and the pixelized elements in levels. _Tiled_ helped me to compose a good layout for each level. As a game engine, _Phaser 3_ had all the properties that could help me to create a game completely.

The little touch I added in this game to make a unique experience is to control the avatar's ability to fly through the microphone. My purpose in adding this input is because of the universe itself. The character being a cloud makes sense that wind would guide Flufluf through the levels, so the user can command the flying ability by blowing air into the microphone.

The purpose of this game is to be a pleasant, light-hearted, yet challenging experience. I wanted to create a balance between enjoyment brought by this universe and challenges within the levels. The pleasant aspects are realized through the visual aspects of the game—adorable characters, colourful environments, funny enemies, etc. The challenges come from the enemy's unexpected attacks, the difficulty of controlling the flying ability of the avatar in the gameplay, etc.
